I wrote this project in about 2010. I hope to slowly get this working again because I'd like to use it. It's an ncurses and command line trash can that integrates with linux desktop trash cans. Thus, what's in the desktop trash can shows on the command line and vice versa.

It likely has to be updated to use more modern LLVM compilers.
